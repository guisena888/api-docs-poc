# API Endpoints

All PokÃ©mon CRUD endpoints are fully documented and interactive in our [API Reference](/api).

- Try out requests live
- See all parameters, request/response schemas, and error codes
- Get code samples in curl, JavaScript, Python, and more

> The API Reference is generated from our [OpenAPI spec](../apis/openapi.yaml).

For conceptual guides and usage patterns, see our [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) and [Examples](./examples.mdx) pages.
